#------------Pickling---------------#
# Pickle in Python is primarily used in serializing and deserializing a Python object structure. 
# itâ€™s the process of converting a Python object into a byte stream to store it in a file/database, 
# maintain program state across sessions, or transport data over the network. 
# The pickled byte stream can be used to re-create the original object hierarchy by unpickling the stream.
import pickle
#super(): It is used in subclass to refer the parent class
